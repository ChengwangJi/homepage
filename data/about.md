I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Macau, advised by Prof. [Yuan Wu](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/yuanwu/). Prior to this, I earned my B.Eng. in Electronic Information Engineering and my M.Sc. in Control Science and Engineering, both under the supervision of Prof. [Rong Yu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=4nlL-PwAAAAJ&hl=en) at Guangdong University of Technology. 

My research focuses on **edge computing** and distributed learning, with a particular interest in **federated learning** and **efficient algorithms for AI applications**.

For more details, please see my CV [here](./data/Peichun_CV.pdf).

###

I am working on cleaning up the code for my published paper. The code for some of my papers will be open-sourced soon.

## ðŸ“¢News

- **[April 30, 2025]** Coauthored paper "VimGeo: Efficient Cross-View Geo-Localization with Vision Mamba Architecture" has been accepted by **IJCAI-25**.


## One More Thing

I would like to share some tools I have developedâ€”they might be useful (or maybe not, but hopefully worth a look!).
